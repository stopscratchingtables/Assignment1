Music... It's a way of escape from life, work, and the everyday struggles.
Just when you think music hasn't gotten even better, wait till you listen to the greatest band of all time, "THE BEATLES!" They produced music for a period of time in the 1950s to 1960s. Their music is perfect for making you feel at comfort and home after a long day or simply just to brighten up your morning! <br />
This website has been made, for my assignment 1, in hopes of encouraging people to listen to the beatles' music, and potentially buy some of their merchandise as well! My website consists of a home/introduction page, history page, albums page and store page.
 
## Design Process

This website is intended for the average person, more specifically a person interested in music! My aim of this website is to beef up your music playlist with another few classics from the Beatles. Their songs have definitely changed my prespective and my way of looking at life. I hope it will do the same for many others who many see this website.

While designing this website, I thought about the user's needs, wants and the different ways they may be enticed in using this website. I have categorized the design process into the aesthetics, functinalities and wireframe.

- Aesthetics
  1. Abstractly took colours from the albums I was going to place and used them complimentarily
  2. Carefully chose a background picture that compliments with my colour schemes and fits with the theme of the website
  3. Implemented aesthetic features using CSS
  
 - Functionality
  1. Thought of the functions that the website must include to entice users
  2. Implemeted Features to meet my ideas (Merchandise Shop, Music List)
  3. Implemented Media Queries in the CSS stylesheet to allow multi-platform compatibility
  
- WireFrame
  1. Sketched it by creating a wireframe for my website on Adobe Xd. 
  2. Kept in mind of the designs for both, PC and mobile.
